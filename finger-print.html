    <h2> fingerprints is invented by sir:Fanics galton in 1892.
        Fingerprints are unique patterns of friction ridges on the fingers and thumbs that are used for personal
        identification. These patterns, which are present from birth and do not change over time, are made up of raised
        ridges and valleys. Fingerprints are considered a reliable form of biometrics, meaning they are used to identify
        and authenticate individuals.
        Key aspects of fingerprints:
        Uniqueness:
        No two people, not even identical twins, have the same fingerprints.
        Permanence:
        Fingerprint patterns are formed in utero and remain stable throughout life, unless there is severe damage to the
        deep skin layers.
        Friction Ridges:
        Fingerprints are made up of raised ridges and valleys, which are part of the friction ridge skin.
        Biometric Identification:
        Fingerprints are a key component of biometric identification systems, which are used for authentication and
        access control.
        Forensic Evidence:
        Fingerprints are valuable forens
